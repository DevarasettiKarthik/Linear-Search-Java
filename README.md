# Linear Search in Java

## Description
This program demonstrates the implementation of **Linear Search** in Java.
Linear search sequentially checks each element in the array until the required element is found or the array ends.

## How It Works
- Reads the size of the array
- Stores elements in an array
- Reads the element to be searched
- Compares each element with the search key one by one
- Returns the index if the element is found
- Returns `-1` if the element is not found

## Input Format
<array_size>
<array_elements>
<element_to_search>

## Sample Input
5
10 20 30 40 50
30

## Output
2

If the element is not found:
-1

## Time Complexity
- Best Case: O(1)
- Average Case: O(n)
- Worst Case: O(n)

## Space Complexity
O(1)

## Characteristics
- Simple and easy to implement
- Works on unsorted arrays
- Sequential searching technique

## File Name
